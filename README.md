# bin2mpy
Bin2Mpy is a Python Bin to Mp4 converter that injects MP4 files with payloads for Wii U. Current firmware versions supported: 5.3.2, 5.4.0, 5.5.0, 5.5.1
This code is all heavily based of off Bin2Mp4 (https://github.com/Invertex/WiiU-BIN2MP4/) I just ported it to python so that it can be used in Django and Python apps.
